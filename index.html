<h2>Who am<span class="ich">I</span>?</h2>
I am Saleh, I am 25 years old and live with my family in Zurich.
I have already lived and worked in different countries and gained various experiences (construction, accounting, electrician, trade and decoration). 

Through my professional experience, I have acquired many useful qualities, including discipline, patience and a quick grasp.

I am very interested in the IT field, and therefore I want to have a job as a software developer.

<div class="div3" id="Jetzt">
	<h2>What<span class="ich">i'm</span> doing?</h2>
	In these five years I have experienced and done a lot, namely I attended a German course at the "Migro-klubschule" between 2018 and 2019.
	In 2019, I have a preparation course at Trampoline Basic, and there I would be prepared for the apprenticeship. After that I applied everywhere, but unfortunately without result. 

	Then Iâ€™d know I needed a secondary school degree to have better chance, so I went to an adult secondary school. 

	I finished the course with very good grades, and immediately I sent my CV everywhere, but because of age and other reasons I coulden't find any thing. 

	Since then, I have been working hard to improve my skills, for example, in English, 10 finger writing and IT. 

	I follow an online course for web development on Coursera and i have even done some projects. <span class="label label-default s1 move">

	<h2>What are<span class="ich">My</span> Hobbies?</h2>
Sport is very important to me, so I visit the gym regularly and try to eat healthy. 
	I have loved swimming since childhood, but I like to swim in the indoor pool and not in the lake or river. 

	In the river I do not swim but like to walk there, and sometimes I sit on the river bank and read something.

		I want my English to always improve, and I would like to learn more languages.
